### Analysis of SCOVACLIST terms using ICD-10

In order to better understand the results obtained and the effectiveness of the generated vocabulary, this page presents the comparison between our resource and a controlled terminology. Specifically, we checked if the terms contained in some controlled terminology in Spanish are also contained in SCOVACLIS. Due to the scarcity of terminology resources in Spanish, and more specifically focused on clinical specialties, we have created an analysis based on ICD-10 in its Spanish version. For this purpose, we selected 4 specialties: Otolaryngology, gynecology, neurology and perinatology. Moreover, we  selected several chapters of ICD-10 that could help us to compare. Each chapter of the ICD-10 is composed of concepts. We took the concepts included in different chapters and checked how many of them were included in SCOVACLIS.

We chose four chapters of ICD-10: Chapter 8 - diseases of the ear and mastoid process, chapter 15 -  pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal care, chapter 5 - mental, behavioral, and neuro developmental disorders and chapter 16 - certain conditions originating in the perinatal period. We checked if the concepts found within each chapter were in what we considered the appropriate specialty: otolaryngology, gynecology, neurology and perinatology, respectively.

These chapters do not cover all the related terminology, but they may help us to review our terminology recall with respect to these terms that are very relevant by specialty. In order to make the comparison, we have processed each chapter of ICD-10 following the same process as for our terminology. We have decided to compare only the unigrams since the terminology of ICD-10 is not closely related to the existing vocabulary in the biomedical literature, so bigrams or trigrams extracted from titles or abstracts cannot be adequately compared with formal terminology.

For each chapter of ICD-10 we extracted the unique unigrams and checked how many of them were included in our specialty terminology.

After reviewing each chapter we found that 82.16\% of the chapter 8 unigrams were in our otolaryngology vocabulary, the 82.06\% of the unigrams in chapter 15 were in gynecology, the 82.5\% of the unigrams in chapter 5 were in neurology and 83.47\% of the unigrams in chapter 16 were in perinatology.

We analyzed the terms that were included in ICD-10, but not in our specialty vocabulary and detected they are very unspecific words such as *procedimiento* (procedure), *enfermedad* (disease), *problema* (problem), *anormal* (abnormal), *inusualmente* (unusually), *precipitado* (precipitous) and *inestable* (unstable). 

These are typical examples of important terms, but in multiple specialties. For this reason, they are not sufficiently specific to each specialty and not valid for subsequent classification of documents.
